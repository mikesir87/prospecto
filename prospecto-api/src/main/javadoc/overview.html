  Prospecto is a toolkit for producing textual views of the information in the
  domain model of a Java application.
</p>
<p>
  Using Prospecto, you write _view templates_ in Java using a fluent builder API
  to describe the model objects and properties to include in a view. You can
  then
  your templates to generate views which Prospecto can easily transform into
  JSON,
  XML, and practically any other structured representation format. ASN.1 anyone?
</p>
<p>
  In addition to supporting the generation of views to produce a textual
  representation of your domain model, Prospecto can also apply the information
  in
  a textual representation of your model to create or update domain model
  instances. In other words, you can use Prospecto to facilitate "editing" of
  your
  domain model instances, as well as creating new model instances.
</p>
<p>
  When Prospecto applies a view to create or update a model instance, it does so
  transitively with respect to associated model objects. So you can even edit
  objects that are composed inside of other objects; e.g. when a one-to-one
  relationship exists between a model entity and another model entity. The
  transitive update also applies to collections/arrays of model objects;
  e.g. where you have a one-to-many relationship between a model entity and a
  collection/array of related entities. Prospecto's collection update supports
  adding new objects to a collection, edit existing objects in the collection,
  and removing objects from the the collection.
</p>
<p>
  When applying a view to update a model instance, Prospecto uses standard
  JavaBeans mechanisms for property injection and collection management. Often a
  domain model provides its own methods to manage relationships between
  entities.
  For these situations, Prospecto provides powerful hooks to allow you to
  customize the model update process to ensure that your domain model is updated
  according to the API it exposes.
